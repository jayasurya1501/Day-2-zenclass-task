Q1.Write a blog on the Difference between document and window objects


Document Object:

    *Manages HTML document content and structure.
    *Enables DOM manipulation with methods like getElementById().
    *Alters content with createElement() and handles events.

Window Object:

    *Represents the browser window or tab.
    *Provides global scope for JavaScript with properties like location.
    *Facilitates user interaction through methods like alert().

Differences and Use Cases:

    *Document focuses on content and structure; Window handles browser interaction.
    *Document manipulates the DOM; Window manages global browser scope.
    *Document hierarchy is within Window, representing content within the browser.
